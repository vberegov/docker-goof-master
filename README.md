# Docker Goof

Open a terminal and open the `docker-goof` directory.

1. Build the image

   ```console
   docker build -t docker-goof .
   ```

2. Test the image

   ```console
   snyk test --docker docker-goof --file=Dockerfile
   ```

All-in-one to clone and run:

```console
git clone git@github.com:snyk/docker-goof && \
cd docker-goof && \
docker build -t docker-goof . && \
snyk test --docker docker-goof --file=Dockerfile
```

## Screenshots

All of these screenshots demonstrate the extra value provided when a
Dockerfile is supplied via the CLI `--file` argument.

For example:

  ```console
  snyk test --docker docker-goof --file=Dockerfile
  ```

### Base Image Remediation

This screenshot shows alternative images that may be used in the Dockerfile's
`FROM` line to reduce vulnerabilities. Minor upgrades are the most likely to
be compatible, Major are potentially breaking depending on how the image is
used, and Alternative architecture images are given for more technical users
to investigate.

### Base Image Vulnerability

This screenshot shows an image with a vulnerability introduced by the base

image ..." line

### User-introduced / Dockerfile Vulnerability

This screenshot shows an image introduced by a user in their Dockerfile and
highlights the exact command that introduced the vulnerability, with the
"Introduced in your Dockerfile by ..." line
